1. See [[file:SLinkedList.lox]].
2. 
   a) Should strings be null-terminated? That's not very necessary in a modern language.
   b) Should `if`, `else`, `while`, and `for` blocks need brackets if they contain only one statement? No, and indeed they aren't. If one wants to keep the brackets, one can just write them? Such restrictions don't have to be baked in.
   c) Should there be an `else if`? Apparently, there already is.
   d) Should `print` insert a newline automatically? Perhaps not, unless there is another printing function/statement that does not do so.
   e) Let A be a class and B be a subclass that inherits from A, and let f, g be methods in A, and f', g' be the redefined versions of f and g resp. in B. If f refers to g, and f' is called, would it g or g' be then called? Fortunately, the latter, and that makes sense.
   f) Is `this = [some other instance]` valid? No. And that probably wouldn't be very useful.
   g) Is `this == [some other instance]` valid? Yes. I don't see the use, but idk.
3. 
   a) Operations like `+=`, `-=`, or `*=`.
   b) Not having to use `this` when a field's usage is unambiguous.
   c) Arrays.
   d) Loop keywords such as `break` and `continue`.
   e) Asserts and type/class-checking (normally part of a standard library?).
   f) Switch statements.
   g) For-each loops.
