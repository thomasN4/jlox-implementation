1. expr -> expr stuff
   expr -> IDENTIFIER
   expr -> NUMBER

   stuff -> stuff methods_or_args
   stuff -> methods_or_args

   methods_or_args -> "(" maybe_args ")"
   methods_or_args -> "." IDENTIFIER

   maybe_args -> args
   maybe_args -> ""

   args -> args "," expr
   args -> ""

   I don't know what sort of expression this grammar encodes. `3.14(x,y,z)` and `2.7.x` appear to conform to that grammar. Overall, it seems that function calls, attribute calls (including on number literals), number literals, and variables are valid expressions in that grammar.

2. For Haskell, you just use typeclasses.
