1. Example with Java:
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     // Suppose we decide that `char` is equivalent to `true` and `int` to false for a moment.
     branch(condition);

     // Then branch.
     void branch(char x) {
         // Do a thing.
     }

     // Else branch.
     void branch(int x) {
         // Do a different thing.
     }
   #+END_SRC

   Apparently, Smalltalk and CLOS rely primarily on dynamic dispatch for their control flow.

2. That optimization would be to convert recursion into iteration at compile time. Otherwise, there could be stack overflow problems or it's simply much slower. Haskell, and perhaps several other functional languages, uses optimized recursion for iteration.
