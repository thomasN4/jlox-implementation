1. Because functions declarations always come with its definition?

2. In Java, this sort of redefinition at compile-time, and in C, it compiles and works as in Lox used to, but could result in undefined behavior. I prefer how Java handles the problem, because such redefinitions are almost certainly mistakes.

3. My implementation reports warnings instead. See source code.

4. Not totally sure what was meant. My solution is a huge mess. See source code.
